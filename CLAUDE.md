# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a **GitHub profile repository** for user `iwantaljaard`. The README.md file in this repository automatically displays on the user's GitHub profile page at `github.com/iwantaljaard`.

## Repository Structure

- **README.md**: The only file in this repository. This markdown file serves as the user's GitHub profile introduction and is displayed prominently on their GitHub profile page.

## Development Workflow

Since this is a profile repository with only markdown content, there are no build, test, or lint commands. Changes are made directly to README.md.

**To see changes on GitHub profile:**
1. Edit README.md
2. Commit changes
3. Push to the repository
4. Changes will appear on the GitHub profile immediately

## Current Content

The README contains a minimal personal introduction. The file includes a commented-out template with suggestions for additional profile sections (projects, skills, contact info, etc.) that could be added.
